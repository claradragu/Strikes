Predict Baseball Strike Zones With Machine Learning
Support Vector Machines are powerful machine learning models that can make complex decision boundaries. An SVM’s decision boundary can twist and curve to accommodate the training data.

In this project, we will use an SVM trained using a baseball dataset to find the decision boundary of the strike zone.

The strike zone can be thought of as a decision boundary that determines whether or not a pitch is a strike or a ball. There is a strict definition of the strike zone — in practice, however, it will vary depending on the umpire or the player at bat.

Let’s use our knowledge of SVMs to find the real strike zone of several baseball players.
